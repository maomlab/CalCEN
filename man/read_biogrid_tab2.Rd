\title{parse BioGRID tab2 format}
\usage{
From the command line, download the by-organism biogrid dataset for the desired release and filter for the desired organism

    BIOGRID_RELEASE=3.4.161
    ORGANISM_NAME=Candida_albicans_SC5314
    pushd raw_data
    wget https://downloads.thebiogrid.org/Download/BioGRID/Release-Archive/BIOGRID-${BIOGRID_RELEASE}/BIOGRID-ORGANISM-${BIOGRID_RELEASE}.tab2.zip
    unzip BIOGRID-${BIOGRID_RELEASE}/BIOGRID-ORGANISM-${BIOGRID_RELEASE}.tab2.zip
    ls | grep -v -e "${ORANISM_NAME}" | xargs rm
    popd

from R, parse biogrid data
